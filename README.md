Setup Instructions:

1.Clone the repo

    source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

    Install dependencies

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Configure PostgreSQL DB
    Edit config.py:

    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost/library'

4.Run migrations

12.Design Choices

    Chose PostgreSQL for strong consistency, indexing, and relational integrity.

    Used JWT instead of API key system for better session management.

    Designed modular structure (views, models, urls, utils) for clean separation of concerns.

    Handled book availability and status at model level via custom logic.
